## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that there's moments where you need to utilize your existing tools, and not attempt to re-invent the wheel.
Took me days attempting to build the accordion panels, I think my problem was trying to rush in. When what I should've done is broken it down more. I guess in restrospect after seeing how others have addressed it, I can now better understand the steps to take.

### Continued development

I'd like to continue to learn how to build these common components, atleast to the point where it comes with ease.
I won't be too hard on myself becasue I know these things come with time!
